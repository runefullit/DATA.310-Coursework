# Tic Tac Toe exercise.
The point of this exercise was to familiarize oneself with adversarial search using minimax. Implementing alpha-beta pruning was voluntary, but provides a noticeable speedup to early actions that the computer takes.
The student only modified the tictactoe.py file, where only initial_state() method was built. The student implemented all other methods required by the runner.py.
