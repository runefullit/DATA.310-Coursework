#Nim game.

Using Q-learning, we teach the computer to play Nim over 10 000 epochs.

The learning process builds a state machine, where each game state, and available action is paired with iteratively calculated expected result.

This is a peer reviewed course exercise. The student only completes implementation for several functions in class NimAI described in the accompanied PDF.
